Builder pattern solves some of the problems with factory and abstract factory design patterns when the object contains lot of
attributes.
The issue is solved with a large number of optional parameters and inconsistent state by providing a way to build
the object step-by-step and provide a method that will actually return the final object.
This helps to produce the different types of representations for a object.
