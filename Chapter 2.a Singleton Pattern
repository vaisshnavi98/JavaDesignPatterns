Singleton patterns tells that only one object/one instance can be created for a particular and only it can be used to access the class.
This single instance of the class acts as global access point to the class.
This way we can have control the access to the shared resource.
This cannot be implemented by using a regular constructor.
The singleton patterns allows us to have a global object and protects it at the same time from being overwritten.

Implentation of Singleton Pattern:
1. Make your default constructor private , to prevent other objects from using new operator with singleton class.
2. Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor, through which the method calls the private constructor to create an ovject and saves it in a static field.All calls to the method return this cached object.

Example: Government is a perfect example of singleton pattern , a country can have only one governement official regardless of how many people will be in that post.
